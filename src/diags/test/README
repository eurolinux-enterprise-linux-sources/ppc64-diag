To create a .pg2 file that represents an entirely healthy Bluehawk, run:
$ make
$ ./bh_mk_healthy xxx.pg2


To create a .pg2 file that represents (sort of) a Bluehawk with an overheating
power supply, run:
$ make
$ ./bh_mk_hot_power xxx.pg2

You can simulate other problems by writing programs similar to mk_hot_power.c.

When you feed such a file to diag_encl using the -f option, remember that
you also need to provide a .vpd file.  Just copy sg8.vpd and rename it.


To create .pg2 file from Bluehawk enclosure, run:
$ make
$ ./bh_dump_pg2 <sgN> <output_file>


To dump the Bluehawk vpd data, run:
$ make
$ bh_vpd <sgN>


To dump the Bluehawk structure size, run :
$ make
$ bh_structs
